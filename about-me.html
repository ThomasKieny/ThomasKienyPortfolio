									<h1>Nice to meet you!</h1>
									<p>I'm Thomas, 29 and passionate about data analysis and the infinite possibilities it offers.<br />
									If you want to make the most of your data and grow your business, contact me.</p>
								</header>
								<h3>Get to know me</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="" /></span>I'm a <b>data analyst and marketing professional</b> 
									who has held positions as product and project manager in the pharmaceutical and electrical industries, 
									as well as in communications agencies. I began a professional reconversion in early 2023 to throw
									myself fully into the world of data, and more specifically data analysis. 
									<br /><br />I've always been passionate about data trying to make figures speak for themselves. The assignments I've enjoyed the most so far are those that have enabled me to analyze the commercial performance of products when I worked as a product manager, or those that led me to study the results of digital campaigns in my current position. Trying to understand what's behind the data, to improve the product or service and exceed targets. <b>Finding that little something, hidden in the immensity of the data collected, that can make a significant difference</b> : that's what motivates me to give my best.</br>
									<br />Today, through this portfolio, I'd like to show you how I can be a real asset for your company as a data analyst through my strategic thinking, analytical skills using Excel, SQL, Python and Power BI and curiosity about different topics.									
									<br /><br />Now you know a little bit more about me.<b> If you want to make the most of your data and grow your business, I'm right here, you're only one call away.</b></p>
